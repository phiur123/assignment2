In a "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow, Everyone makes pulls from the central repository and push changes to the assigned lietenant repository.
Then the Lietenant repositories are merged to the Dictator repository and only the dictator can push to it. 
While in a "Integration Manager" workflow, each developer has a public and private repository and 
makes pushes to their public repository and pull from the central repository. 
An Integration Manager then resolves conflicts and pushes to the central repository.

A team of 100 developers would benefit from a "Dictator and Lieutenants" workflow over a "Centralized" workflow
since there would be a branch for every developer's changes. This would lead to countless conflicts as each 
developer implemented changes. With a Dictator and Lieutenant workflow, the conflicts would be lessened.
